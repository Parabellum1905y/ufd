#summary Bookmarklet for simple trial of UFD on your page!

= BOOKMARKLET STILL IN BETA =

= Introduction =

This bookmarklet will allow you to try out UFD on any web page you like with no installation!  The bookmarklet script will automatically inject all the needed script and CSS, and wrap all (non-multi) select drop-downs.  

It is only modifying the local page, and is discarded on page refresh etc.  All forms should still submit completely correctly - remember that the _U_ stands for _Unobtrusive_.

Simply drag the link below on to your bookmark bar, visit the target website, then select the bookmarklet. 


<wiki:gadget url="http://ufd.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bookmarklet/bookmarkletGaget.xml" height="20" width="200" border="0" /> 

The script will automatically detect and use existing jQuery if already on page, and will apply itself to all visible, non-multi select tags, i.e.

`jQuery("select:not([multiple]):visible").ufd();`

If you want this in iE6, you need to create the bookmarklet manually.  Create a new bookmark to anywhere, and replace the bookmarks' URL with the link URL/href below.  You can get this with a _right click -> copy shortcut_ on the link.


= Known issues =

 * CSS styles on target pages may bleed into plugin, causing slight render weirdness.  For example, this page has left and right padding on a span tag if placed where the "search" select is.  This causes the UFD to render with extra padding.  It still functions correctly, of course.  Try it out!
 * Sites using versions of jQuery < 1.3.0 will not work, as the script detects an existing jQuery and attempts to use it, but the plugin needs 1.3.0+.
