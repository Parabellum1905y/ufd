#summary Rationale for forking away from [http://code.google.com/p/sexy-combo/ sexy-combo]

= Introduction =

UFFDD is a fork from [http://code.google.com/p/sexy-combo/ sexy-combo].  This page explains the rationale.


= Details =

The main developer of UFFDD initally intended to enrich the sexy-combo for all its current users in a few important areas:

* Performance with large lists
* Improved event handling
* Better iE6 z-index support

During the development of these improvements, lots of features had to be dropped or changed.  The new plugin ended up not being compatible with the previous versions in a few ways: Skin CSS changed, plugin options changed and the tool is in effect completely different.  Some of the (potentially important) lost features include:

* Multiple selection in a single combo (<select multiple="true" .. >)
* Custom filter functions (UFFD uses a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie trie] implementation)
* JSON support (might be reintroduced)
* Custom callbacks (UFFDD triggers events on original select instead)
