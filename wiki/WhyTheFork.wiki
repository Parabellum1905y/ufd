#summary Rationale for forking away from Sexy-combo.

= Introduction =

UFFDD is a fork from [http://code.google.com/p/sexy-combo/ sexy-combo].  This page explains the rationale.


= Details =

The main developer of UFFDD initially intended to enrich the sexy-combo for all its current users in a few important areas:

  * Performance with large lists
  * Improved event handling
  * Better iE6 z-index support

During the development of these improvements, lots of features had to be dropped or changed.  The new plugin ended up not being compatible with the previous versions in a few ways, and the plugin is in effect quite different.  

Some of the potentially important *removed* features include:

  * Multiple selection in a single combo (ie <select multiple .. >)
  * Custom filter functions (UFFD uses a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie trie] implementation)
  * Backwards compatibility with CSS skins
  * Many configuration options
  * JSON support (might be reintroduced)
  * Custom callbacks (UFFDD triggers events on original select instead)

Sexy-combo also had some releases sponsored by a company, and removal of features that may be important to them seems unfair.  And finally, the name sexy-combo name may be a minus for the more conservative uses (corporate etc.).

For these reasons, it seemed better to fork the project, hence the "Unobtrusive Fast Filter Drop Down" was born.  Why the fork not?
